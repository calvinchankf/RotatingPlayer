### Heyüñê
If your ViewController(which plays videos) can be in both portrait and landscape, I strongly recommend that to do it with AutoLayout and ignore this post.

***But if you want to know how to do it with AutoLayout as well, change the storyboard entry point to RotatingViewController and try it.***
